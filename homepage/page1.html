    <p>Hello, my name is Klaris Gizdov, currently in the year 2023 17 year old living in my home land Bulgaria, and I'm really happy to share my first project with you which you are currently using! <p>For the past years I've been in a
      high school where I'm being thought economics, human right's, finance and so more! But the bad part about is that it's not my thing and I have been trying to find where I belong.</p> <p>So currently I'm taking a FREE <a href=https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home>CS50 Harvard course</a> about
      the introduction to programming, including the main language of the course C, Python, JS, HTML, CSS, SQL and so much more interesting stuff. It has really been a pleasure taking this course, not only because of the great teaching
      and learning methods, but about where it will lead me later in life. It has made me very interested in programming, and I have not stopped thinking about it everyday since I started! I'm really hoping to continue and never give up on
      this big opportunity for me, and the <a href=http://127.0.0.1:8080/homepage/page2.html>future</a> of computer science!</p>
